Those are the sources of new upcoming version encryptedtears told you were lost. They never were, he just does what he always does.

SESHapp will no longer be maintaned in both AppStore & GooglePlay. Any 'new' version you'll see - just the result of complete theft of my idea of all-inclusive app. I can even predict what next features it'll have.

Free to fork, modify, copy, blame on me.

Thereâ€™s a lot of shitcode, boilerplate, weakness, but here it is. Some features do not work, because I still had no time to finish it. 

Sorry to all the people I promised to release it.
