Those are the sources they told you were lost. They never were. Enjoy.

I decided I don’t want to spend time on this anymore 

Free to fork, modify, copy, blame on me.

A little disclaimer for my defence:
As one wise friend told me: every time I plan to recode SESHapp my views on programming in android (in this case — iOS) change.

There’s a lot of shitcode, boilerplate, weakness, but here it is. Some features do not work, because I still had no time to finish it.

Sorry to all the people I promised to release.
